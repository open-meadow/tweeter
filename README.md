## Getting Started

- You need to have Node JS installed on your computer. You can download it at (https://nodejs.org/en/).
- Once you have Node JS, go to your desired folder, open the terminal or command prompt, and type <code>git clone git@github.com:open-meadow/tinyapp.git tinyapp</code>, if you have git. Alternatively, you can download the ZIP file and extract it to your desired folder.
- Once done, navigate to the folder containing the downloaded code, and open your terminal or command prompt in the same folder ( Windows users, click on the empty space on the box beside the search bar and type 'cmd'). Type `npm install` Windows users may need to run cmd as administrator.
- Once installed, type `npm start` and click `Enter`.
- Go to your favourite web browser, and type `localhost:8080` in the address bar. Hit `Enter`. You should be able to access the website.

## Known Bugs

- Visual error - If user input returns an error, and the very next input causes a different error, the error message immediately changes before sliding up. Does not affect functionality.
